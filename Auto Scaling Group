//Subnet: Select all the subnets.
//Click on the Next button.
Step6. Configure advanced options

//Click on the Next button 
Step10.	Now scroll down and click on the Create Auto Scaling group button.
Step11.	Whiz-ASG Auto scaling is created successfully.
Step12.	You will be redirected to the autoscaling group page, you will be able to see that two instances are launched by the autoscaling group.
Step13.	Now go to the EC2 instances list. You will see that there are two new running instances (which were created by your autoscaling group) You can confirm this from their tag name, which you gave at the time of creating the autoscaling group.
Step14.	You have successfully created an autoscaling group with a policy of a minimum of 1 and a maximum of 2 instances
Test Auto Scaling Group
Step1.	For testing the auto-scaling policy, go to the EC2 instance list and select one of your instances.
Step2.	Next, select an instance and click on Instance state and then Stop instance.
Step3.	Click the Stop button on the pop-up window to stop your instance.
Step4.	Once your instance is stopped (after 1-2 minutes) you can see that your stopped instance will be terminating automatically, and a new instance will be launched to fulfill the policy condition. A sample screenshot is provided below:
//Launching a new instance may take a few minutes, you can refresh the page to view the new instance.
